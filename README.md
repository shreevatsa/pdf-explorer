Some code that parses a PDF file into objects. There's also some very preliminary WIP code to display the file structure on a web page.

# What is this?

At the lowest level, a PDF file is a sequence of 8-bit bytes.

At the next lowest level (and almost just as useless), a PDF file is a collection of **objects** (surrounded by a header and trailer). The code here only concerns itself with this level.

Specifically, there are 8 types of objects:

-   [x] Boolean Objects
-   [x] Numeric Objects
-   [x] String Objects
-   [x] Name Objects
-   [x] Array Objects
-   [x] Dictionary Objects
-   [x] Stream Objects
-   [x] Null Object

Additionally, we also (need to) parse:

-   [x] Indirect Object definitions (12 0 obj â€¦ endobj)
-   [x] Indirect object references (12 0 R)
-   [x] File structure: Header, body, cross-reference table, trailer.

Some notes:

-   It can now round-trip via JSON. That is, if you dump to JSON and read back, you will get the exact same bytes.

    -   This is not as impressive as it sounds, because we could in principle just dump the sequence of bytes into JSON as an array of numbers. However, here we're doing _slightly_ more than that.

-   Assumes the input is valid, e.g. does not check in dict for unique keys, does not check for stream length, etc. In fact, parses the file "forwards", rather than starting with the trailer first.

## Try it out

Using from Rust code: `src/lib.rs` has a library that parses a PDF file into PDF objects.

Web interface (WIP, calls the parser but does not display anything much yet):

- Run `build.sh` and `python3 -m http.server` (or [equivalent](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255)), then access http://[::]:8000/, or
- Visit https://shreevatsa.net/pdf-explorer/ (the trailing slash is important, unfortunately)

I haven't yet tried either of these, but they seem to be further along (IIUC they're written in Python and generate HTML):

## Old notes

Status currently:

- Out of 19560 PDF files I have, this works correctly for 8724 of them.

- As of 2022-04-30 (970471e): Works for 19262 out of 19560 files. So fails for 298 (not all of which are actually PDF files).

- As of 2022-05-01 (child of 970471e): Works for 19430 out of 19562 files. So fails for 132 files.

- As of 2022-05-01 (after deleting some dupes): Works for 19382 out of 19493 files. So fails for 111 files.

- As of 2022-05-01 11:52: Works for 19420 out of 19493 files. So fails for 73 files.

- As of 2022-05-01 14:20 (e54b45e): Works for 19426 out of 19492 files. So "fails" for 66 files. Looked at each of them. They are all malformed in some way or the other.
